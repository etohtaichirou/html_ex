          And he went back to meet the fox. "Goodbye," he said. "Goodbye," said
          the fox. "And now here is my secret, a very simple secret: It is only
          with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is
          invisible to the eye." "What is essential is invisible to the eye,"
          the little prince repeated, so that he would be sure to remember. "It
          is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so
          important." "It is the time I have wasted for my rose--" said the
          little prince, so that he would be sure to remember. "Men have
          forgotten this truth," said the fox. "But you must not forget it. You
          become responsible, forever, for what you have tamed. You are
          responsible for your rose . . ." "I am responsible for my rose," the
          little prince repeated, so that he would be sure to remember.
